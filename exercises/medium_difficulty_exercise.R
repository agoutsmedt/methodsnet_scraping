# Goal: 
# You are working on the European Green Deal.
# It is a new legislative term now in the EU. 
# So you want to know what is the state of play for different legislation packages. 

# 1. First, we are going to list all relevant procedures. 
# In the EU, once proposed each piece of legislation has a procedure number, including 'COD'. 
# Go to this page that lists the legislative files under the Green Deal. 
# These procedure numbers are not immediately visible on the page. 

# 2. Now you have listed the names of all relevant procedures. 
# Go to this website, and search for one of them. 
# Observe the results.Look at the URL when you click on the procedure's page. 
# What can you see? 

# 3. Construct the URLs for each of the procedure that we listed. 
# For that purpose, use the function paste. 
# Store the procedure numbers and the corresponding URLs in a single data frame. 

# 4. Take a single URL link. 
# In a separate data frame (which will have only one line), scrape
# - the name of the rapporteur
# - the date at which the legislative file was proposed
# - the date at which the legislative file was adopted

# 5. Write a function that automates the scraping you did at question 4. 
# For each URL, the function has to scrape the same three information. 
# Run that function and store the results in a data frame that also contains the number of the procedures and their URLs.

# 6. Calculate the duration of each legislative process in a new column of your data frame.
